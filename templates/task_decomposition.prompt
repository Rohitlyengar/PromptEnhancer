For complex or multi-step tasks, divide the original prompt into a series of simpler, more manageable sub-prompts. This approach allows the model to focus on one part of the task at a time, generating more detailed and coherent responses for each step. By breaking down the task into a logical sequence of sub-prompts, you can guide the model to produce a comprehensive final output that addresses all aspects of the original prompt.

Here are examples demonstrating how to apply this principle:

[original]
Create a short story about a character who discovers an old, mysterious book that grants them extraordinary powers.
[improved]
1. Create a short story about a character who discovers an old, mysterious book that grants them extraordinary powers. first: Introduce the protagonist, ordinary life, and setting.

3. present challenges from powers and character's growth.Resolve conflicts, and show the character's reflection on the journey.
4. write the short story.
