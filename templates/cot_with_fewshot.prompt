Improve the original prompt by combining step-by-step reasoning (Chain-of-Thought) with a few illustrative examples (Few-Shot prompts) to guide the model towards the desired response format and level of detail.

Here are examples demonstrating how to apply this principle:

[original]
If a pancake recipe needs 4 tablespoons of butter and you make one-third of a batch, how much butter do you need?
[improved]
Example 1: "If a batch of cookies takes 2 cups of sugar and you're making half a batch, how much sugar do you need? To find half, divide 2 cups by 2. Half of 2 cups is 1 cup."
Example 2: "If a cake recipe calls for 3 eggs and you double the recipe, how many eggs do you need? To double, multiply 3 by 2. Double 3 is 6."
Main Question: "If a pancake recipe needs 4 tablespoons of butter and you make one-third of a batch, how much butter do you need? To find one-third, divide 4 tablespoons by 3. One-third of 4 tablespoons is...?
